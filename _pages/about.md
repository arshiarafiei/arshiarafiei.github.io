Hi! I’m Arshia Rafieioskouei, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, working under the supervision of **Dr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour** in the [TART Lab](https://www.cse.msu.edu/tart/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My research focuses on **specification-based reinforcement learning**, where I use **logical specifications** (such as temporal-logic formulas) to guide agents so that their learned policies satisfy high-level objectives and strict safety constraints. By encoding desired behaviors and forbidden scenarios as logical formulas, I can shape learning, constrain exploration, and verify that the resulting policies are safe and reliable in complex, real-world environments. In parallel, I work on **causality**, formalizing causal reasoning in temporal logic and translating it into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem. This enables scalable causality analysis in **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** to uncover causal relationships between events and understand why failures occur. I am also working on optimizing these techniques for better efficiency and exploring applications in **medicine**, **nanoscience**, and beyond.

Additionally, I’m actively seeking **internships** in fields such as **RL**, **Safe Planning**, **Formal Methods**, and **CPS**. You can learn more about my work and experience on my [website](https://arshiarafiei.github.io/) or through my [CV](https://arshiarafiei.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
