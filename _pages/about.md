Hi! I’m Arshia Rafieioskouei, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My research focuses on **causality**, specifically formalizing it using temporal logic to transform it into an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) problem. This approach allows me to deploy causality analysis in **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** to uncover causal relationships between events. I’m also working on optimizing this process for better efficiency and exploring applications in **medicine**, **nanoscience**, and beyond.

If you're interested in discussing **causality**—in any form—or if you have a dataset where you'd like to uncover causal relationships, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:rafieios@msu.edu).

Additionally, I’m actively seeking **internships** in fields such as **CPS**, **safety failures**, **formal methods**, and **verification**. You can learn more about my work and experience on my [website](https://arshiarafiei.github.io/) or through my [CV]().
